## Introduction

The iLogBaseStreambase is a big data component, responsible for collecting in a scalable way data about the platform 
users and for feeding them to those components that have activated a feed subscription 
(or are periodically requesting for updates). 
The data may have been generated by another component within the platform or may be coming directly from one of the 
connectors of the Commons APIs. 

## Server

An instance of this component can be found at http://streambase.disi.unitn.it:8096

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-ilogbase.yml up
