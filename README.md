# WENET ILOGBASE

## Introduction

The iLogBase is a big data component, responsible for collecting in a scalable way data about the platform users and for feeding them to those components that have activated a feed subscription (or are periodically requesting for updates).

 The data may have been generated by another component within the platform or may be coming directly from one of the connectors of the Commons APIs.
Users can access its functionalities and retrieve or submit data through the apis described in the documentation.

## Setup and Configuration

The iLogBase component requires Java version 8 or later.

You can run the iLogBase using maven:

```
mvn clean package

java -jar target/ilogbase-<version>.jar 
```

### Docker Support 

Alternatively you can run iLogBase using docker.

You will need to install docker and docker-compose. 

Once you have both of them installed you can simply run the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-ilogbase.yml up
```


### Server
